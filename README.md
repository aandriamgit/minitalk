Signals Speak Louder Than Words

In Minitalk, the client doesn’t simply fire-off text messages over to the server; remember we are dealing at the low-level. The client crafts a symphony of character-by-character, 8 bit at a time with ‘1’s and ‘0’s, uses the SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals switching to compose the melody.
